Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a frontier in AI where robots can understand and interact with the world through a combination of visual perception, natural language comprehension, and physical action. This module explores:

- **Multimodal Perception**: Integrating data from cameras, LiDAR, and other sensors with linguistic context.
- **Language Grounding**: Connecting natural language commands and descriptions to objects, locations, and actions in the robot's environment.
- **Action Planning**: Generating sequences of physical movements based on VLA model outputs.
- **Embodied AI**: The concept of AI systems that learn and reason within a physical body, directly experiencing the world.

We will examine architectures that enable robots to interpret complex instructions, learn from demonstrations, and perform tasks by leveraging advanced AI techniques that bridge the gap between perception, cognition, and action.
