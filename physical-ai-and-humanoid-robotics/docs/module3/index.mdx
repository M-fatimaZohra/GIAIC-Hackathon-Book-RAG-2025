NVIDIA Isaac is a comprehensive platform for accelerating the development and deployment of AI-powered robots. This module delves into how Isaac serves as the "brain" of advanced robots, providing:

- **Isaac SDK**: A collection of tools, APIs, and algorithms for robot perception, navigation, manipulation, and human-robot interaction.
- **Isaac Sim**: A scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool built on NVIDIA Omniverse, enabling photorealistic simulations and AI training.
- **Jetson Platform**: Edge AI devices (like Jetson Nano, Xavier, Orin) that provide the computational power for running AI models on robots.

We will explore how to leverage Isaac's capabilities for tasks such as object detection, pose estimation, path planning, and reinforcement learning for robotic control.
