## Introduction to ROS 2

Module 1 introduces the Robotic Operating System 2 (ROS 2), a flexible framework for writing robot software. It acts as the central nervous system, coordinating communication and functionality across various robot components. This module provides a foundational understanding of ROS 2's architecture, core concepts, and practical applications in developing intelligent robotic systems.

### Key Concepts

*   **Nodes**: The fundamental building blocks of a ROS 2 system, representing independent executable processes.
*   **Topics**: A publish/subscribe mechanism for asynchronous data exchange between nodes.
*   **Services**: A request/reply communication model for synchronous interactions, useful for specific actions or queries.
*   **Actions**: Designed for long-running, goal-oriented tasks that require feedback and the ability to be preempted.
*   **Parameters**: Configuration values that can be dynamically adjusted for ROS 2 nodes.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

*   Explain the role of ROS 2 in modern robotics.
*   Identify and describe core ROS 2 concepts (nodes, topics, services, actions, parameters).
*   Understand the message-passing architecture within ROS 2.
*   Set up a basic ROS 2 workspace and execute fundamental commands.

### Conclusion

ROS 2 provides a robust and scalable infrastructure for robotics development. A solid grasp of its core principles is essential for integrating hardware, implementing complex behaviors, and collaborating on large-scale robotics projects.
