The Capstone Project provides an opportunity to integrate all the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course to design, build, and deploy an autonomous humanoid robot system. This module focuses on the practical application of:

- **ROS 2**: For inter-component communication and robot control.
- **Simulation Environments**: Using Gazebo or Unity for testing and validation.
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: For AI perception, navigation, and manipulation tasks.
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models**: For high-level understanding and decision-making.

Students will work on a real-world challenge, such as a pick-and-place task, human-robot collaboration, or autonomous navigation in a complex environment. The project emphasizes iterative development, debugging, and performance optimization, culminating in a demonstration of a fully integrated autonomous humanoid system.
