Robots rely on a diverse array of sensors to perceive their environment and gather information for decision-making. This appendix provides an overview of common sensor types used in physical AI and humanoid robotics:

- **Vision Sensors (Cameras)**: For capturing visual data, enabling object detection, recognition, and pose estimation.
- **Depth Sensors (LiDAR, RGB-D Cameras)**: For measuring distances to objects, creating 3D maps, and obstacle avoidance.
- **Force/Torque Sensors**: For measuring interaction forces, crucial for delicate manipulation and human-robot collaboration.
- **Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)**: For tracking orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration, essential for balancing and navigation.
- **Proprioceptive Sensors**: Sensors that provide feedback about the robot's own state, such as joint angles and motor currents.

Understanding the capabilities and limitations of different sensors is fundamental for designing robust and intelligent robotic systems.
