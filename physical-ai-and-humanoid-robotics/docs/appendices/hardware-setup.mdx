This appendix provides essential guidance for setting up hardware for physical AI and humanoid robotics projects. Proper hardware configuration is crucial for reliable robot operation.

- **Robot Platform**: Choosing an appropriate robot platform (e.g., wheeled robot, robotic arm, humanoid robot) based on project requirements.
- **Embedded Computers**: Setting up embedded systems like NVIDIA Jetson boards, Raspberry Pi, or other single-board computers for on-robot processing.
- **Sensor Integration**: Connecting and configuring various sensors (cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, force/torque sensors) to the robot's control system.
- **Actuator Wiring and Control**: Wiring motors (DC, servo, stepper) and integrating motor controllers with the embedded computer.
- **Power Management**: Designing and implementing a robust power supply system, including batteries, voltage regulators, and power distribution.
- **Networking**: Configuring wireless or wired network connectivity for communication between the robot and a remote workstation.

Detailed instructions for specific hardware components and platforms will be provided in accompanying lab materials.
