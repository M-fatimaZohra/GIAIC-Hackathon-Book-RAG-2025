This glossary defines key terms and concepts used throughout the textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.

- **Actuator**: A component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system.
- **Autonomous System**: A system that can perform tasks without continuous human input.
- **Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a physical object or system.
- **End-Effector**: The part of a robot that interacts with its environment; often at the 'end' of a robotic arm.
- **Forward Kinematics**: The calculation of the position and orientation of the end-effector from the given joint angles.
- **Gazebo**: An open-source 3D robot simulator.
- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: The study of interactions between humans and robots.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: The calculation of the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position and orientation.
- **LiDAR**: Light Detection and Ranging, a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges.
- **Nodes (ROS 2)**: Independent processes in ROS 2 that perform specific tasks.
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: A platform for accelerating the development and deployment of AI-powered robots.
- **Proprioception**: The sense of the relative position of one's own body parts and strength of effort being used in movement.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: (Previously planned for chatbot) An AI model architecture that combines information retrieval with text generation.
- **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: An open-source middleware suite for robot software development.
- **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**: The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.
- **Teleoperation**: The operation of a machine or robot at a distance.
- **Topics (ROS 2)**: A publish/subscribe messaging system in ROS 2 for inter-node communication.
- **Unity**: A cross-platform game engine that can also be used for robot simulation.
- **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML file format for describing all elements of a robot.
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models**: AI models that combine visual perception, natural language understanding, and physical action.
