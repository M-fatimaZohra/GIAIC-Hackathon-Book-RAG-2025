Robotics heavily relies on a foundational understanding of mathematics, particularly linear algebra, calculus, and geometry. This appendix covers key mathematical concepts applied in robotics:

- **Linear Algebra**: Vectors, matrices, and transformations are fundamental for representing robot kinematics, dynamics, and sensor data.
- **Homogeneous Transformations**: Combining rotation and translation into a single matrix for representing poses and transformations between coordinate frames.
- **Kinematics**: Describing the motion of a robot without considering the forces that cause it. This includes:
    - **Forward Kinematics**: Calculating the end-effector pose from joint angles.
    - **Inverse Kinematics**: Calculating joint angles required to reach a desired end-effector pose.
- **Differential Kinematics (Jacobian)**: Relating joint velocities to end-effector velocities, crucial for motion control.
- **Probability and Statistics**: For sensor fusion, state estimation (e.g., Kalman filters), and machine learning algorithms.

Mastering these mathematical tools is essential for analyzing, designing, and controlling robotic systems effectively.
