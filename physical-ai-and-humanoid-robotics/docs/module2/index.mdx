sidebar_position: 3
---

Digital twins are virtual representations of physical systems, crucial for simulating, testing, and optimizing robotic designs before deploying them in the real world. This module explores popular simulation environments:

- **Gazebo**: A powerful 3D robot simulator widely used in robotics research and development, offering realistic physics, sensors, and environments.
- **Unity**: A versatile game development platform that can also be leveraged for high-fidelity robot simulations, especially for visual rendering and human-robot interaction.

Key aspects covered include building virtual robot models (URDF/SDF), setting up simulation environments, integrating with ROS 2, and conducting experiments in a safe, repeatable virtual space.
