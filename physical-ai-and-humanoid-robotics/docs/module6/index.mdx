Module 6 covers advanced topics and provides opportunities for in-depth exploration through specialized labs. These topics may vary based on emerging trends in physical AI and humanoid robotics, but commonly include:

- **Advanced Control Systems**: Delving into adaptive control, optimal control, and robust control techniques for highly dynamic robot systems.
- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: Exploring intuitive interfaces, collaborative robotics, and social aspects of humanoid robots.
- **Ethical AI in Robotics**: Discussing the societal impact, ethical considerations, and responsible development of autonomous systems.
- **Quantum Robotics (Emerging Field)**: An introduction to the potential future intersection of quantum computing and robotics.

Advanced labs provide hands-on experience with cutting-edge hardware or software tools, allowing students to conduct research-level experiments and contribute to ongoing projects in the field.
