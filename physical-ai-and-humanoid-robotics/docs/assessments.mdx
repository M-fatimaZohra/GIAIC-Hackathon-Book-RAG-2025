## Assessment Structure

The course "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" utilizes a multifaceted assessment approach to evaluate student understanding of theoretical concepts and their ability to apply practical skills. Assessments are designed to reinforce learning and encourage critical thinking throughout the quarter.

### Components of Assessment

*   **Weekly Lab Assignments (40%)**
    *   Hands-on programming tasks related to ROS 2, simulation, and AI modules.
    *   Submissions include code, short reports, and demonstration videos.
    *   Focus on practical implementation, debugging, and problem-solving.

*   **Midterm Project (25%)**
    *   A focused mini-project that integrates concepts from Modules 1-4.
    *   Requires design, implementation, and a brief presentation.
    *   Evaluates conceptual understanding and early-stage integration skills.

*   **Final Capstone Project (35%)**
    *   The culminating project of the course, involving the design, development, and demonstration of an autonomous humanoid robot system (simulated or physical, depending on resources).
    *   Includes a comprehensive project report, code repository, and a final presentation/demonstration.
    *   Assesses the ability to integrate diverse technologies, manage a complex project, and achieve defined objectives.

### Grading Rubric

*   **Correctness and Functionality**: Does the code/robot perform as expected and meet all requirements?
*   **Design and Architecture**: Is the solution well-structured, modular, and maintainable?
*   **Documentation and Readability**: Is the code well-commented, and are reports clear and concise?
*   **Innovation and Creativity**: (For Capstone) Does the project demonstrate novel approaches or solve challenges in an interesting way?
*   **Presentation and Demonstration**: Is the project effectively communicated and demonstrated?

### Academic Integrity

All submitted work must be original. Collaboration on concepts is encouraged, but individual assignments and projects must reflect independent effort. Any instances of plagiarism or academic dishonesty will be dealt with according to university policies.

### Conclusion

The diverse assessment methods ensure that students gain both a deep theoretical understanding and robust practical skills, preparing them for advanced roles in the field of physical AI and humanoid robotics.
