*   **Community Support and Documentation**: Prioritize kits with active communities, extensive tutorials, and well-maintained documentation. This will be invaluable for troubleshooting and learning.

### Customizing Your Kit: Unleashing Creativity

Student kits are not rigid platforms; they are springboards for innovation. Students are highly encouraged to customize their kits to explore specific research interests or unique project ideas. The modular design of ROS 2 and the open-source nature of many of these platforms support extensive modifications and enhancements.

*   **Mechanical Modifications**: Explore structural enhancements or modifications to the robot's chassis or arm components (with caution and safety in mind).

### Getting Started with Your Kit: Practical Setup Advice

Once you've acquired your student kit, follow these general steps to get started:

1.  **Read the Manual Thoroughly**: Before powering anything on, meticulously read all provided documentation, assembly instructions, and quick-start guides.
2.  **Assemble Carefully**: Follow the assembly instructions precisely. Double-check all connections (power, data, motors, sensors) before applying power.
3.  **Initial Software Setup**: Install the recommended operating system (often a customized Linux distribution) and core software stack (e.g., ROS 2, NVIDIA JetPack for Jetson devices).
4.  **Network Configuration**: Ensure your robot can connect to your local network (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) for remote access and communication with your workstation.
5.  **Run Basic Demos**: Execute the provided sample code or tutorials to verify that all components are functioning correctly (motors move, sensors provide data, camera streams).
6.  **Version Control**: Initialize a Git repository for your project code on the kit's computer and push it to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub).
7.  **Explore ROS 2 Tutorials**: Work through basic ROS 2 tutorials (e.g., `ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker`) to understand the publish/subscribe model and other core concepts.
