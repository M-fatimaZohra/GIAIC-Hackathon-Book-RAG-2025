## Enhancing Practical Experience with Student Kits

To facilitate hands-on learning and practical application of course concepts, various student kits are available or recommended. These kits provide accessible hardware platforms for experimentation with ROS 2, basic AI perception, and robot control, complementing both simulation-based and advanced lab exercises.

### Recommended Student Kits

*   **Entry-Level Robotics Kit (e.g., TurtleBot 4 Lite)**:
    *   **Components**: Mobile base, Raspberry Pi 4, LiDAR, RGB-D camera.
    *   **Capabilities**: Ideal for learning ROS 2 navigation, mapping (SLAM), and simple manipulation tasks.
    *   **Benefits**: Relatively affordable, well-documented, and widely supported by the ROS community.

*   **Mid-Range AI Robotics Kit (e.g., NVIDIA JetBot AI Kit or F1TENTH Platform)**:
    *   **Components**: NVIDIA Jetson Nano/Orin, high-resolution camera, motor drivers, mobile chassis.
    *   **Capabilities**: Suitable for implementing edge AI applications, object detection, autonomous driving (scaled), and more complex perception tasks.
    *   **Benefits**: Provides direct experience with NVIDIA Jetson hardware and AI deployment on embedded systems.

*   **Robotic Arm Kit (e.g.,UFACTORY Lite 6-axis, myCobot)**:
    *   **Components**: 6-axis robotic arm, gripper, control board.
    *   **Capabilities**: Focuses on robotic manipulation, inverse kinematics, pick-and-place tasks, and advanced motion control.
    *   **Benefits**: Develops skills crucial for industrial automation and precise interaction with objects.

### Kit Selection Guidance

*   **Beginner**: Start with an entry-level mobile robot kit to grasp ROS 2 fundamentals and basic navigation.
*   **AI/Perception Focus**: Opt for kits with NVIDIA Jetson components for hands-on AI deployment.
*   **Manipulation Focus**: Choose a robotic arm kit for learning precise control and object interaction.

### Customizing Your Kit

Students are encouraged to customize their kits with additional sensors (e.g., IMUs, force sensors) or custom-designed components to explore specific research interests or project ideas. The modular nature of ROS 2 and the openness of these platforms support extensive modifications.

### Conclusion

Student kits serve as excellent platforms for applying theoretical knowledge to physical systems. They bridge the gap between abstract concepts and tangible robotic behaviors, providing invaluable practical experience for aspiring physical AI and humanoid robotics engineers.
