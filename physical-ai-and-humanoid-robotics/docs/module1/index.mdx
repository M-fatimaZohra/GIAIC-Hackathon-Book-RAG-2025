The Robotic Operating System (ROS 2) serves as the "nervous system" for many advanced robots, providing a flexible framework for writing robot software. This module introduces the core concepts of ROS 2, including:

- **Nodes**: Independent processes that perform specific tasks (e.g., controlling a motor, reading sensor data).
- **Topics**: A publish/subscribe messaging system for inter-node communication.
- **Services**: A request/reply mechanism for remote procedure calls between nodes.
- **Actions**: For long-running tasks with feedback and cancellability.
- **Parameters**: Dynamic configuration values for nodes.

Understanding ROS 2 is crucial for developing complex robotic applications, enabling modular design, code reuse, and seamless integration of various hardware and software components.
