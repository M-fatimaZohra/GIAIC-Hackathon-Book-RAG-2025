## Overview of Hardware Needs

Successful engagement with the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course requires access to specific hardware and computing resources. This section outlines the recommended and minimum specifications for workstations, edge kits, and various lab options to ensure students can effectively run simulations, develop AI models, and interact with robotic platforms.

### Workstation Requirements

*   **Recommended Specifications**:
    *   **Processor**: Intel Core i7 (10th Gen or newer) / AMD Ryzen 7 (3000 series or newer)
    *   **RAM**: 32 GB DDR4
    *   **Graphics Card**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 (or equivalent AMD) with 8GB VRAM or more
    *   **Storage**: 1 TB SSD (NVMe preferred)
    *   **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (or newer) / Windows 10/11 with WSL2 and Docker Desktop
*   **Minimum Specifications**:
    *   **Processor**: Intel Core i5 (8th Gen or newer) / AMD Ryzen 5 (2000 series or newer)
    *   **RAM**: 16 GB DDR4
    *   **Graphics Card**: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 (or equivalent AMD) with 6GB VRAM
    *   **Storage**: 500 GB SSD
    *   **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

### Edge Kit (Optional but Recommended)

An edge AI kit is highly recommended for hands-on experience with deploying AI models directly onto robotic hardware. These kits provide the computational power for on-robot processing.

*   **NVIDIA Jetson Development Kit**:
    *   **Recommended**: NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit (or Jetson AGX Orin)
    *   **Minimum**: NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit

### Peripherals

*   **Webcam**: For basic vision tasks and video conferencing.
*   **Microphone/Headset**: For virtual labs and collaboration.
*   **Ethernet Port**: Stable network connection for robot communication.

### Conclusion

Meeting these hardware requirements will enable students to fully participate in all aspects of the course, from complex simulations to practical AI development and robotic control.
