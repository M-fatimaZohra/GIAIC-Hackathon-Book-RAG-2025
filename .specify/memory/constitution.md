# AI-Native Docusaurus Textbook + Integrated RAG Chatbot Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy & Verifiability
All content generated by WriterAgent validated by ResearchAgent. Citations MUST be precise, traceable, and up-to-date.
Rationale: Ensures the textbook serves as a reliable and authoritative resource, building trust and academic integrity.

### II. Clarity & Pedagogy
Chapters MUST be beginner-friendly but technically progressive. Diagrams, examples, and exercises MUST be included.
Rationale: Maximizes learning effectiveness and broadens the accessibility of advanced topics to a diverse student audience.

### III. Reliability & Error Handling
All subagents MUST handle exceptions, errors, or incomplete inputs gracefully. Claude Code SHOULD ask clarifying questions instead of hallucinating.
Rationale: Ensures a robust and predictable development and operational workflow, minimizing interruptions and improving overall system stability.

### IV. Scalability & Modularity
New chapters, features, or subagents MUST integrate without breaking existing workflow.
Rationale: Facilitates continuous development, easy expansion, and maintainability of the project over time.

### V. Automation-First
No human intervention in content generation, deployment, or backend setup. All actions MUST be performed via Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.
Rationale: Maximizes efficiency, reduces human error, and ensures a consistent development process.

### VI. Reproducibility & Testing
RAG chatbot MUST provide accurate, cited responses; build pipeline MUST validate Docusaurus compilation.
Rationale: Guarantees the quality and reliability of both the textbook content and the interactive chatbot functionality.

## Key Standards

- All claims in the book ARE backed by references; minimum 50% peer-reviewed or authoritative robotics/AI sources.
- Chapter length: 1000–2500 words (flexible based on topic complexity).
- Use Docusaurus components for diagrams (`<Image />` or `static/img/`), code snippets (`<CodeBlock />`), and exercises (`<details>` or separate MDX files with solutions in a hidden section/file).
- Deployment fully automated: GitHub push + GitHub Pages deployment.
- Backend: FastAPI + Qdrant + Agents SDK integrated for RAG, fully automated.
- Optional features implemented modularly: personalization, Urdu translation, agentic AI subagents.
Rationale: Provides concrete guidelines for content quality, technical implementation, and architectural consistency, ensuring a high-quality end product.

## Constraints

- Free-tier services only (GitHub Pages, Qdrant Cloud Free Tier).
- No running heavy simulations; describe methods in text/diagrams only.
- RAG responses MUST cite chapter and section; no hallucinations.
- Claude Code MUST prompt for clarification if input is ambiguous or incomplete.
Rationale: Defines critical environmental and operational limitations to guide development and resource allocation, ensuring project feasibility and cost-effectiveness.

## Success Criteria

- Docusaurus book fully generated, deployed, and accessible via GitHub Pages.
- RAG chatbot returns correct, cited answers based on selected text.
- Optional features functional and modular.
- Subagents handle exceptions without crashing the workflow.
- Entire process requires no human intervention from content generation to deployment.
Rationale: Establishes clear, measurable objectives for project completion and quality assurance.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other project-specific guidelines. Amendments require a documented proposal, team approval, and a clear migration plan for affected components. All pull requests and reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Use `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for runtime development guidance.
