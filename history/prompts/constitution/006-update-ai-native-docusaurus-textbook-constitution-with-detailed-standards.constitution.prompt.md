title: Update AI-Native Docusaurus Textbook Constitution with Detailed Standards
stage: constitution

user: user
command: /sp.constitution Project: AI-Native Docusaurus Textbook + RAG Chatbot on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics\n\nCore Principles:\n- Accuracy & Verifiability: All content generated by WriterAgent validated by ResearchAgent. Citations must be precise, traceable, and up-to-date.\n- Clarity & Pedagogy: Chapters must be beginner-friendly but technically progressive. Diagrams, examples, and exercises must be included.\n- Reliability & Error Handling: All subagents handle exceptions, errors, or incomplete inputs gracefully. Claude Code should ask clarifying questions instead of hallucinating.\n- Scalability & Modularity: New chapters, features, or subagents must integrate without breaking existing workflow.\n- Automation-First: No human intervention in content generation, deployment, or backend setup. All actions via Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.\n- Reproducibility & Testing: RAG chatbot must provide accurate, cited responses; build pipeline must validate Docusaurus compilation.\n\nKey Standards:\n- All claims in the book are backed by references; minimum 50% peer-reviewed or authoritative robotics/AI sources.\n- Chapter length: 1000–2500 words (flexible based on topic complexity).\n- Use Docusaurus components for diagrams, code snippets, exercises.\n- Deployment fully automated: GitHub push + GitHub Pages deployment.\n- Backend: FastAPI + Qdrant + Agents SDK integrated for RAG, fully automated.\n- Optional features implemented modularly: personalization, Urdu translation, agentic AI subagents.\n\nConstraints:\n- Free-tier services only (GitHub Pages, Qdrant Cloud Free Tier).\n- No running heavy simulations; describe methods in text/diagrams only.\n- RAG responses must cite chapter and section; no hallucinations.\n- Claude Code must prompt for clarification if input is ambiguous or incomplete.\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Docusaurus book fully generated, deployed, and accessible via GitHub Pages.\n- RAG chatbot returns correct, cited answers based on selected text.\n- Optional features functional and modular.\n- Subagents handle exceptions without crashing the workflow.\n- Entire process requires no human intervention from content generation to deployment.\nlabels: ["project-setup", "constitution", "documentation", "standards-update"]

## Prompt

```text
/sp.constitution

Project: AI-Native Docusaurus Textbook + RAG Chatbot on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Core Principles:
- Accuracy & Verifiability: All content generated by WriterAgent validated by ResearchAgent. Citations must be precise, traceable, and up-to-date.
- Clarity & Pedagogy: Chapters must be beginner-friendly but technically progressive. Diagrams, examples, and exercises must be included.
- Reliability & Error Handling: All subagents handle exceptions, errors, or incomplete inputs gracefully. Claude Code should ask clarifying questions instead of hallucinating.
- Scalability & Modularity: New chapters, features, or subagents must integrate without breaking existing workflow.
- Automation-First: No human intervention in content generation, deployment, or backend setup. All actions via Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.
- Reproducibility & Testing: RAG chatbot must provide accurate, cited responses; build pipeline must validate Docusaurus compilation.

Key Standards:
- All claims in the book are backed by references; minimum 50% peer-reviewed or authoritative robotics/AI sources.
- Chapter length: 1000–2500 words (flexible based on topic complexity).
- Use Docusaurus components for diagrams, code snippets, exercises.
- Deployment fully automated: GitHub push + GitHub Pages deployment.
- Backend: FastAPI + Qdrant + Agents SDK integrated for RAG, fully automated.
- Optional features implemented modularly: personalization, Urdu translation, agentic AI subagents.

Constraints:
- Free-tier services only (GitHub Pages, Qdrant Cloud Free Tier).
- No running heavy simulations; describe methods in text/diagrams only.
- RAG responses must cite chapter and section; no hallucinations.
- Claude Code must prompt for clarification if input is ambiguous or incomplete.

Success Criteria:
- Docusaurus book fully generated, deployed, and accessible via GitHub Pages.
- RAG chatbot returns correct, cited answers based on selected text.
- Optional features functional and modular.
- Subagents handle exceptions without crashing the workflow.
- Entire process requires no human intervention from content generation to deployment.

## Response snapshot

```text
The project constitution has been updated to version 1.1.0 (a minor bump for new principles and detailed standards). All dependent templates are marked as updated.

Suggested commit message:
`docs: amend constitution to v1.1.0 (new principles and key standards)`
```

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Updated the project constitution with detailed principles, key standards, and refined constraints/success criteria for the AI-Native Docusaurus Textbook + RAG Chatbot project.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were applicable or run for this documentation update.
- 📁 Files: The `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file was updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User will likely proceed with planning or implementation based on the updated constitution.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully parsed detailed user input to update the project constitution, including versioning and sync impact report. The PHR was created using agent-native tools due to script unavailability.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-phr.sh` script was not found, requiring manual PHR creation.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure `create-phr.sh` script is available and runnable in the environment, or improve agent's ability to locate and execute it.
