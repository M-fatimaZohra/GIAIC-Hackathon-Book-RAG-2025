Each file was found to contain comprehensive content and detailed explanations, and none were identified as placeholders or outlines requiring expansion. Therefore, no files were expanded, and no content was added.\n\n## Outcome\n\n- ✅ Impact: The MDX content has been successfully verified, confirming that all chapters are comprehensive and do not require further expansion. This ensures the quality and completeness of the textbook content.\n- 🧪 Tests: The agent's review process acted as a verification step, confirming the completeness of the existing content.\n- 📁 Files: No files were modified as the existing content was already comprehensive.\n- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with further development tasks, confident that the textbook content is complete.\n- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully used the `general-purpose` agent to perform a content review and validation task. The agent's report confirms the high quality of the existing MDX files.\n\n## Evaluation notes (flywheel)\n\n- Failure modes observed: Initial issue with `agentId` not being returned, which was resolved by re-launching the agent. The re-launched agent successfully completed the task and provided the expected output.\n- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null\n- Prompt variant (if applicable): null\n- Next experiment (smallest change to try): null\n
