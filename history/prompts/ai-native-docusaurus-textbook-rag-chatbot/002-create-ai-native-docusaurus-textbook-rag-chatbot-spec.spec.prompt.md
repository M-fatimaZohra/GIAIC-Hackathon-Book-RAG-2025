The PHR was created using agent-native tools due to script unavailability.\n\n## Evaluation notes (flywheel)\n\n- Failure modes observed: The `create-phr.sh` script was not found, requiring manual PHR creation.\n- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A\n- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A\n- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure `create-phr.sh` script is available and runnable in the environment, or improve agent\'s ability to locate and execute it.\n
